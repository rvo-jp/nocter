# nocter-declarations

## Responsibility

Own the immutable, syntax-independent declaration graph and its namespaces, visibility, callable,
requirement, standard-role, and target metadata. Define the sparse structural-constant and dense
final-value products without evaluating either one.

## Contract

The crate supplies domain types, builders, and validated immutable products. It knows semantic
identities and normalized declaration relationships but not source text, syntax trees, editor
coordinates, or checking internals.

## Internal Responsibilities

- declaration and member arenas
- one sparse structural-constant table and one independently validated dense declaration-value
  table, both separate from constant and static metadata
- module, import, and prelude namespaces
- callable execution, guarantees, canonical input/result provenance graphs, constant, and
  requirement contracts
- explicit block or expression body forms, with constant and static initializers represented by
  ordinary semantic body identities rather than embedded syntax
- canonical interface dependency paths, `Self`-inheritance closure, and effective member identities
- visibility and path contracts
- accepted/recovery admission shapes

## Invariants

- Builders reserve and define every declaration identity exactly once before metadata freeze.
  `PreparedDeclarationProgram` owns a sparse structural-constant builder; it is a construction-only
  capability and cannot cross into checking. Its consuming finish transition validates that table
  and publishes checking admission without pretending ordinary initializers are already executed.
- Graph/type integrity, structural-constant integrity, and final declaration-value integrity are
  validated independently.
- Namespace lookup consumes frozen tables rather than iterating declarations.
- A selected import is validated against the exact authored name/target pair in its target module
  namespace. Re-exported targets may retain an original declaration owner in another module; the
  import validator does not confuse physical declaration ownership with exported surface ownership.
- A declaration identity never contains a source range or rendered name.
- Authored callable execution and guarantees are declaration data; consumers do not rediscover
  modifiers from syntax or result shapes.
- Callable input provenance stores resolved receiver and parameter identities. Source spellings,
  header walk order, and body inference cannot enter that graph.
- Invalid or incomplete graphs cannot be constructed as accepted programs.
- `DeclarationProgram` contains graph/type metadata only. Declaration records never embed
  evaluated constant or static payloads. Accepted and recovery declaration branches carry only
  structural constants; `CheckedProgram` later owns the dense final value table.
- Every constant and immutable static owns exactly one expression-form body. Every callable,
  destruction, and test implementation owns a block-form body. Integrity validation proves both
  directions of each relationship before the graph can leave construction.
- An accepted immutable program may create owned checking branches without rebuilding declaration
  decisions; every branch preserves semantic IDs and the type-authority lineage.
- Interface prerequisite cycles and effective member collisions cannot cross the accepted-program
  boundary.
- Dependency-cycle validation follows every interface predicate; member inheritance follows only
  contextual `Self impl Interface` predicates.
