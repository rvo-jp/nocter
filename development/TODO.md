# Nocter Development Handoff

## Current Task

Continue v0.14.0 Phase 3 by defining the immutable checked-program model and implementing
body-owned name resolution without importing syntax into canonical checked semantics.
The previous compiler is preserved by commit `f6c08da3` and removed from the active working tree.
No previous source, test, binary behavior, or implementation document may be used as an
implementation input.

## Immediate Work

1. Define the immutable checked-program and body-owned HIR contracts, including stable body-local
   identities and a one-way source projection boundary. Do not create expression side maps or a
   second declaration/name authority.
2. Implement lexical body scopes and exact name resolution as the first checked-program slice,
   with source-backed diagnostics and ordering-invariant conformance cases.
3. Move block-import selection into those lexical scopes, consuming discovery-owned module targets
   and the frozen module export namespace without mutating `DeclarationProgram`.

Phase 2 is complete. `lower_compile_unit_declarations` is the sole production declaration facade
and returns one immutable `DeclarationProgram` plus an independent `SourceIndex`. Every facade
failure is exhaustively classified as an authored rule or an internal compiler/discovery integrity
error. Declaration-owned G006-G010, G012-G013, and G015-G018 fixtures compare complete projected
diagnostics under reversed package and module input order. Type equalities are validated after
alias expansion, and projection-free general equalities project `E0320` without retaining syntax
inside canonical requirement identity.
The Phase 3 responsibility map is recorded in `development/docs/checked-program-design.md`.
`DeclarationProgram` now retains authored and prelude-fallback module namespace layers as the sole
body-lookup authority. `nocter-checking` catalogs every `BodyId` from exact source projection and
validates its physical source against the semantic owner module. Missing or inconsistent
projections remain internal boundary errors.

## Guardrails

- Do not restore or inspect the archived compiler.
- Do not migrate archived tests or diagnostics.
- Do not run a released compiler to discover unspecified behavior.
- Do not treat the existing standard-library implementation as language semantics.
- Do not mark specification closure complete while an observable choice remains implicit.
- Do not let Phase 3 reparse declaration headers, infer syntax from resolved names, or place source
  ranges and rendered names in checked semantic identity.
